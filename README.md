Guess a composer correctly and hear one of their works!
  --note--the audio play function does not work correctly, and it has not been yet fixed. 
  I have set the play function to play an excerpt by Rachmaninoff upon any user win. 
  The game still logs user keystrokes, wins, losses, & updates accordingly. Just need
  to iron out to audioplay function kink. With that said, mp3s are limited as I didn't want
  to spend time uplaoding them simply for them not to be heard
  
  List of Composers & Corresponding musical pieces:
  Rachmaninoff - Zdes' khorosho (How Fair This Spot) op21#7 --this is currently heard upon user win--<br>
  Barber - Adagio for Strings<br>
  Mozart - Overture from "Die Zauberflote" (The Magic Flute)<br>
  Vaughan Williams - Five Variants of 'Dives and Lazarus'<br>
  --these audio files not yet included<br>
  Verdi - Triumphal March from "Aida"<br>
  Chopin - Nocturne #2 in E-Flat op9#2<br>
  Bach - Cello Suite 1 in GMajor<br>
